Description: X cursor management library
 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.
