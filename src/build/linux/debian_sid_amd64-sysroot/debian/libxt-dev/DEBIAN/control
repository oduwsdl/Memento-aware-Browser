Description: X11 toolkit intrinsics library (development headers)
 libXt provides the X Toolkit Intrinsics, an abstract widget library upon
 which other toolkits are based.  Xt is the basis for many toolkits, including
 the Athena widgets (Xaw), and LessTif (a Motif implementation).
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxt6.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
