Description: NSS module for using Berkeley Databases as a naming service
 nss_db is a set of C library extensions which allow Berkeley Databases
 to be used as a primary source of aliases, ethers, groups, hosts,
 networks, protocol, users, RPCs, services, and shadow passwords (instead
 of or in addition to using flat files or NIS). Install nss_db if your
 flat name service files are too large and lookups are slow.
