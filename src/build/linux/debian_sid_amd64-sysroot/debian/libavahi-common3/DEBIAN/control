Description: Avahi common library
 Avahi is a fully LGPL framework for Multicast DNS Service Discovery.

 running on a local network with no specific configuration. For
 example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
 print to, files to look at and people to talk to.
 .
 This package contains the Avahi common library, which is a set of common
 functions used by many of Avahis components and client applications.
