Description: X11 Xinerama extension library (development headers)
 libXinerama provides an X Window System client interface to the XINERAMA
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Xinerama (also known as panoramiX) extension allows for multiple screens
 attached to a single display to be treated as belonging together, and to give
 desktop applications a better idea of the monitor layout.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxinerama1.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
