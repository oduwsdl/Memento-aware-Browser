E.18 Traceframe Info Format
===========================

To be able to know which objects in the inferior can be examined when
inspecting a tracepoint hit, GDB needs to obtain the list of memory
ranges, registers and trace state variables that have been collected in
a traceframe.

   This list is obtained using the `qXfer:traceframe-info:read' (*note
qXfer traceframe info read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

   The top-level structure of the document is shown below:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE traceframe-info
               PUBLIC "+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN"
                      "http://sourceware.org/gdb/gdb-traceframe-info.dtd">
     <traceframe-info>
        block...
     </traceframe-info>

   Each traceframe block can be either:

   * A region of collected memory starting at ADDR and extending for
     LENGTH bytes from there:

          <memory start="ADDR" length="LENGTH"/>

   * A block indicating trace state variable numbered NUMBER has been
     collected:

          <tvar id="NUMBER"/>


   The formal DTD for the traceframe info format is given below:

     <!ELEMENT traceframe-info  (memory | tvar)* >
     <!ATTLIST traceframe-info  version CDATA   #FIXED  "1.0">

     <!ELEMENT memory        EMPTY>

E.19 Branch Trace Format
========================

In order to display the branch trace of an inferior thread, GDB needs
to obtain the list of branches.  This list is represented as list of
sequential code blocks that are connected via branches.  The code in
each block has been executed sequentially.

   This list is obtained using the `qXfer:btrace:read' (*note qXfer
btrace read::) packet and is an XML document.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML traceframe
info discovery.  *Note Expat::.

   * A block of sequentially executed instructions starting at BEGIN
     and ending at END:

Appendix F The GDB Agent Expression Mechanism
*********************************************

In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program's execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program's correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program's behavior without interrupting it.

   Using GDB's `trace' and `collect' commands, the user can specify
locations in the program, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate when
those locations are reached.  Later, using the `tfind' command, she can
examine the values those expressions had when the program hit the trace
points.  The expressions may also denote objects in memory --
structures or arrays, for example -- whose values GDB should record;
while visiting a particular tracepoint, the user may inspect those
objects as if they were in memory at that moment.  However, because GDB
records these values without interacting with the user, it can do so
quickly and unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program's
behavior.

   When GDB is debugging a remote target, the GDB "agent" code running
on the target computes the values of the expressions itself.  To avoid
having a full symbolic expression evaluator on the agent, GDB translates
expressions in the source language into a simpler bytecode language, and
then sends the bytecode to the agent; the agent then executes the
bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.

   The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the
bulk of which are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition,
subtraction, shifts, and so on) and various sizes of literals and
memory reference operations.  The bytecode interpreter operates
strictly on machine-level values -- various sizes of integers and
floating point numbers -- and requires no information about types or
symbols; thus, the interpreter's internal data structures are simple,
and each bytecode requires only a few native machine instructions to
implement it.  The interpreter is small, and strict limits on the
memory and time required to evaluate an expression are easy to
determine, making it suitable for use by the debugging agent in
real-time applications.

File: gdb.info,  Node: General Bytecode Design,  Next: Bytecode Descriptions,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.1 General Bytecode Design
===========================

The agent represents bytecode expressions as an array of bytes.  Each
instruction is one byte long (thus the term "bytecode").  Some
instructions are followed by operand bytes; for example, the `goto'
instruction is followed by a destination for the jump.

   The bytecode interpreter is a stack-based machine; most instructions
pop their operands off the stack, perform some operation, and push the
result back on the stack for the next instruction to consume.  Each
element of the stack may contain either a integer or a floating point
value; these values are as many bits wide as the largest integer that
can be directly manipulated in the source language.  Stack elements
carry no record of their type; bytecode could push a value as an
integer, then pop it as a floating point value.  However, GDB will not
generate code which does this.  In C, one might define the type of a
stack element as follows:
     union agent_val {
       LONGEST l;
       DOUBLEST d;
     };
   where `LONGEST' and `DOUBLEST' are `typedef' names for the largest
integer and floating point types on the machine.

   By the time the bytecode interpreter reaches the end of the
expression, the value of the expression should be the only value left
on the stack.  For tracing applications, `trace' bytecodes in the
expression will have recorded the necessary data, and the value on the
stack may be discarded.  For other applications, like conditional
breakpoints, the value may be useful.

   Separate from the stack, the interpreter has two registers:
`pc'
     The address of the next bytecode to execute.

`start'
     The address of the start of the bytecode expression, necessary for
     interpreting the `goto' and `if_goto' instructions.

   Neither of these registers is directly visible to the bytecode
language itself, but they are useful for defining the meanings of the
bytecode operations.

   There are no instructions to perform side effects on the running
program, or call the program's functions; we assume that these
expressions are only used for unobtrusive debugging, not for patching
the running code.

   Most bytecode instructions do not distinguish between the various
sizes of values, and operate on full-width values; the upper bits of the
values are simply ignored, since they do not usually make a difference
to the value computed.  The exceptions to this rule are:
memory reference instructions (`ref'N)
     There are distinct instructions to fetch different word sizes from
     memory.  Once on the stack, however, the values are treated as
     full-size integers.  They may need to be sign-extended; the `ext'
     instruction exists for this purpose.

the sign-extension instruction (`ext' N)
     These clearly need to know which portion of their operand is to be
     extended to occupy the full length of the word.


   If the interpreter is unable to evaluate an expression completely for
some reason (a memory location is inaccessible, or a divisor is zero,
for example), we say that interpretation "terminates with an error".
This means that the problem is reported back to the interpreter's caller
in some helpful way.  In general, code using agent expressions should
assume that they may attempt to divide by zero, fetch arbitrary memory
locations, and misbehave in other ways.

   Even complicated C expressions compile to a few bytecode
instructions; for example, the expression `x + y * z' would typically
produce code like the following, assuming that `x' and `y' live in
registers, and `z' is a global variable holding a 32-bit `int':
     reg 1
     reg 2
     const32 address of z
     ref32
     ext 32
     mul
     add
     end

   In detail, these mean:
`reg 1'
     Push the value of register 1 (presumably holding `x') onto the
     stack.

`reg 2'
     Push the value of register 2 (holding `y').

`const32 address of z'
     Push the address of `z' onto the stack.

`ref32'
     Fetch a 32-bit word from the address at the top of the stack;
     replace the address on the stack with the value.  Thus, we replace
     the address of `z' with `z''s value.

`ext 32'
     Sign-extend the value on the top of the stack from 32 bits to full
     length.  This is necessary because `z' is a signed integer.

`mul'
     Pop the top two numbers on the stack, multiply them, and push their
     product.  Now the top of the stack contains the value of the
     expression `y * z'.

`add'
     Pop the top two numbers, add them, and push the sum.  Now the top
     of the stack contains the value of `x + y * z'.

`end'
     Stop executing; the value left on the stack top is the value to be
     recorded.

F.2 Bytecode Descriptions
=========================

Each bytecode description has the following form:

`add' (0x02): A B => A+B
     Pop the top two stack items, A and B, as integers; push their sum,
     as an integer.


   In this example, `add' is the name of the bytecode, and `(0x02)' is
the one-byte value used to encode the bytecode, in hexadecimal.  The
phrase "A B => A+B" shows the stack before and after the bytecode
executes.  Beforehand, the stack must contain at least two values, A
and B; since the top of the stack is to the right, B is on the top of
the stack, and A is underneath it.  After execution, the bytecode will
have popped A and B from the stack, and replaced them with a single
value, A+B.  There may be other values on the stack below those shown,
but the bytecode affects only those shown.

   Here is another example:

`const8' (0x22) N: => N
     Push the 8-bit integer constant N on the stack, without sign
     extension.


   In this example, the bytecode `const8' takes an operand N directly
from the bytecode stream; the operand follows the `const8' bytecode
itself.  We write any such operands immediately after the name of the
bytecode, before the colon, and describe the exact encoding of the
operand in the bytecode stream in the body of the bytecode description.

   For the `const8' bytecode, there are no stack items given before the
=>; this simply means that the bytecode consumes no values from the
stack.  If a bytecode consumes no values, or produces no values, the
list on either side of the => may be empty.

   If a value is written as A, B, or N, then the bytecode treats it as
an integer.  If a value is written is ADDR, then the bytecode treats it
as an address.

   We do not fully describe the floating point operations here; although
this design can be extended in a clean way to handle floating point
values, they are not of immediate interest to the customer, so we avoid
describing them, to save time.

`float' (0x01): =>
     Prefix for floating-point bytecodes.  Not implemented yet.

`add' (0x02): A B => A+B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their sum, as an integer.

`sub' (0x03): A B => A-B
     Pop two integers from the stack, subtract the top value from the
     next-to-top value, and push the difference.

`mul' (0x04): A B => A*B
     Pop two integers from the stack, multiply them, and push the
     product on the stack.  Note that, when one multiplies two N-bit
     numbers yielding another N-bit number, it is irrelevant whether the
     numbers are signed or not; the results are the same.

`div_signed' (0x05): A B => A/B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

`div_unsigned' (0x06): A B => A/B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the quotient.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

`rem_signed' (0x07): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

`rem_unsigned' (0x08): A B => A MODULO B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; divide the next-to-top
     value by the top value, and push the remainder.  If the divisor is
     zero, terminate with an error.

`lsh' (0x09): A B => A<<B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A left by B bits, and push the
     result.

`rsh_signed' (0x0a): A B => `(signed)'A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting copies
     of the top bit at the high end, and push the result.

`rsh_unsigned' (0x0b): A B => A>>B
     Pop two integers from the stack; let A be the next-to-top value,
     and B be the top value.  Shift A right by B bits, inserting zero
     bits at the high end, and push the result.

`log_not' (0x0e): A => !A
     Pop an integer from the stack; if it is zero, push the value one;
     otherwise, push the value zero.

`bit_and' (0x0f): A B => A&B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise `and'.

`bit_or' (0x10): A B => A|B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise `or'.

`bit_xor' (0x11): A B => A^B
     Pop two integers from the stack, and push their bitwise
     exclusive-`or'.

`bit_not' (0x12): A => ~A
     Pop an integer from the stack, and push its bitwise complement.

`equal' (0x13): A B => A=B
     Pop two integers from the stack; if they are equal, push the value
     one; otherwise, push the value zero.

`less_signed' (0x14): A B => A<B
     Pop two signed integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value
     is less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push
     the value zero.

`less_unsigned' (0x15): A B => A<B
     Pop two unsigned integers from the stack; if the next-to-top value
     is less than the top value, push the value one; otherwise, push
     the value zero.

`ext' (0x16) N: A => A, sign-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; treating it as an N-bit
     twos-complement value, extend it to full length.  This means that
     all bits to the left of bit N-1 (where the least significant bit
     is bit 0) are set to the value of bit N-1.  Note that N may be
     larger than or equal to the width of the stack elements of the
     bytecode engine; in this case, the bytecode should have no effect.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the `ext' bytecode.

`zero_ext' (0x2a) N: A => A, zero-extended from N bits
     Pop an unsigned value from the stack; zero all but the bottom N
     bits.  This means that all bits to the left of bit N-1 (where the
     least significant bit is bit 0) are set to the value of bit N-1.

     The number of source bits to preserve, N, is encoded as a single
     byte unsigned integer following the `zero_ext' bytecode.

`ref8' (0x17): ADDR => A
`ref16' (0x18): ADDR => A
`ref32' (0x19): ADDR => A
`ref64' (0x1a): ADDR => A
     Pop an address ADDR from the stack.  For bytecode `ref'N, fetch an
     N-bit value from ADDR, using the natural target endianness.  Push
     the fetched value as an unsigned integer.

     Note that ADDR may not be aligned in any particular way; the
     `refN' bytecodes should operate correctly for any address.

     If attempting to access memory at ADDR would cause a processor
     exception of some sort, terminate with an error.

`ref_float' (0x1b): ADDR => D
`ref_double' (0x1c): ADDR => D
`ref_long_double' (0x1d): ADDR => D
`l_to_d' (0x1e): A => D
`d_to_l' (0x1f): D => A
     Not implemented yet.

`dup' (0x28): A => A A
     Push another copy of the stack's top element.

`swap' (0x2b): A B => B A
     Exchange the top two items on the stack.

`pop' (0x29): A =>
     Discard the top value on the stack.

`pick' (0x32) N: A ... B => A ... B A
     Duplicate an item from the stack and push it on the top of the
     stack.  N, a single byte, indicates the stack item to copy.  If N
     is zero, this is the same as `dup'; if N is one, it copies the
     item under the top item, etc.  If N exceeds the number of items on
     the stack, terminate with an error.

`rot' (0x33): A B C => C B A
     Rotate the top three items on the stack.

`if_goto' (0x20) OFFSET: A =>
     Pop an integer off the stack; if it is non-zero, branch to the
     given offset in the bytecode string.  Otherwise, continue to the
     next instruction in the bytecode stream.  In other words, if A is
     non-zero, set the `pc' register to `start' + OFFSET.  Thus, an
     offset of zero denotes the beginning of the expression.

     The OFFSET is stored as a sixteen-bit unsigned value, stored
     immediately following the `if_goto' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The offset is not guaranteed to fall at any particular
     alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines where
     fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an exception, you
     should fetch the offset one byte at a time.

`goto' (0x21) OFFSET: =>
     Branch unconditionally to OFFSET; in other words, set the `pc'
     register to `start' + OFFSET.

     The offset is stored in the same way as for the `if_goto' bytecode.

`const8' (0x22) N: => N
`const16' (0x23) N: => N
`const32' (0x24) N: => N
`const64' (0x25) N: => N
     Push the integer constant N on the stack, without sign extension.
     To produce a small negative value, push a small twos-complement
     value, and then sign-extend it using the `ext' bytecode.

     The constant N is stored in the appropriate number of bytes
     following the `const'B bytecode.  The constant N is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The constant is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch N one byte at a time.

`reg' (0x26) N: => A
     Push the value of register number N, without sign extension.  The
     registers are numbered following GDB's conventions.

     The register number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the `reg' bytecode.  It is always stored most
     significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The register number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

`getv' (0x2c) N: => V
     Push the value of trace state variable number N, without sign
     extension.

     The variable number N is encoded as a 16-bit unsigned integer
     immediately following the `getv' bytecode.  It is always stored
     most significant byte first, regardless of the target's normal
     endianness.  The variable number is not guaranteed to fall at any
     particular alignment within the bytecode stream; thus, on machines
     where fetching a 16-bit on an unaligned address raises an
     exception, you should fetch the register number one byte at a time.

`setv' (0x2d) N: => V
     Set trace state variable number N to the value found on the top of
     the stack.  The stack is unchanged, so that the value is readily
     available if the assignment is part of a larger expression.  The
     handling of N is as described for `getv'.

`trace' (0x0c): ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB.

`trace_quick' (0x0d) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Record the contents of the SIZE bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer,
     for later retrieval by GDB.  SIZE is a single byte unsigned
     integer following the `trace' opcode.

     This bytecode is equivalent to the sequence `dup const8 SIZE
     trace', but we provide it anyway to save space in bytecode strings.

`trace16' (0x30) SIZE: ADDR => ADDR
     Identical to trace_quick, except that SIZE is a 16-bit big-endian
     unsigned integer, not a single byte.  This should probably have
     been named `trace_quick16', for consistency.

`tracev' (0x2e) N: => A
     Record the value of trace state variable number N in the trace
     buffer.  The handling of N is as described for `getv'.

`tracenz' (0x2f)  ADDR SIZE =>
     Record the bytes at ADDR in a trace buffer, for later retrieval by
     GDB.  Stop at either the first zero byte, or when SIZE bytes have
     been recorded, whichever occurs first.

`printf' (0x34)  NUMARGS STRING =>
     Do a formatted print, in the style of the C function `printf').
     The value of NUMARGS is the number of arguments to expect on the
     stack, while STRING is the format string, prefixed with a two-byte
     length.  The last byte of the string must be zero, and is included
     in the length.  The format string includes escaped sequences just
     as it appears in C source, so for instance the format string
     `"\t%d\n"' is six characters long, and the output will consist of
     a tab character, a decimal number, and a newline.  At the top of
     the stack, above the values to be printed, this bytecode will pop a
     "function" and "channel".  If the function is nonzero, then the
     target may treat it as a function and call it, passing the channel
     as a first argument, as with the C function `fprintf'.  If the
     function is zero, then the target may simply call a standard
     formatted print function of its choice.  In all, this bytecode
     pops 2 + NUMARGS stack elements, and pushes nothing.

`end' (0x27): =>
     Stop executing bytecode; the result should be the top element of
     the stack.  If the purpose of the expression was to compute an
     lvalue or a range of memory, then the next-to-top of the stack is
     the lvalue's address, and the top of the stack is the lvalue's
     size, in bytes.

F.3 Using Agent Expressions
===========================

Agent expressions can be used in several different ways by GDB, and the
debugger can generate different bytecode sequences as appropriate.

   One possibility is to do expression evaluation on the target rather
than the host, such as for the conditional of a conditional tracepoint.
In such a case, GDB compiles the source expression into a bytecode
sequence that simply gets values from registers or memory, does
arithmetic, and returns a result.

   Another way to use agent expressions is for tracepoint data
collection.  GDB generates a different bytecode sequence for
collection; in addition to bytecodes that do the calculation, GDB adds
`trace' bytecodes to save the pieces of memory that were used.

   * The user selects trace points in the program's code at which GDB
     should collect data.

   * The user specifies expressions to evaluate at each trace point.
     These expressions may denote objects in memory, in which case
     those objects' contents are recorded as the program runs, or
     computed values, in which case the values themselves are recorded.

   * GDB transmits the tracepoints and their associated expressions to
     the GDB agent, running on the debugging target.

   * The agent arranges to be notified when a trace point is hit.

   * When execution on the target reaches a trace point, the agent
     evaluates the expressions associated with that trace point, and
     records the resulting values and memory ranges.

   * Later, when the user selects a given trace event and inspects the
     objects and expression values recorded, GDB talks to the agent to
     retrieve recorded data as necessary to meet the user's requests.
     If the user asks to see an object whose contents have not been
     recorded, GDB reports an error.

F.4 Varying Target Capabilities
===============================

Some targets don't support floating-point, and some would rather not
have to deal with `long long' operations.  Also, different targets will
have different stack sizes, and different bytecode buffer lengths.

   Thus, GDB needs a way to ask the target about itself.  We haven't
worked out the details yet, but in general, GDB should be able to send
the target a packet asking it to describe itself.  The reply should be a
packet whose length is explicit, so we can add new information to the
packet in future revisions of the agent, without confusing old versions
of GDB, and it should contain a version number.  It should contain at
least the following information:

   * whether floating point is supported

   * whether `long long' is supported

   * maximum acceptable size of bytecode stack

   * maximum acceptable length of bytecode expressions

   * which registers are actually available for collection

   * whether the target supports disabled tracepoints



File: gdb.info,  Node: Rationale,  Prev: Varying Target Capabilities,  Up: Agent Expressions

F.5 Rationale
=============

Some of the design decisions apparent above are arguable.

What about stack overflow/underflow?
     GDB should be able to query the target to discover its stack size.
     Given that information, GDB can determine at translation time
     whether a given expression will overflow the stack.  But this spec
     isn't about what kinds of error-checking GDB ought to do.

Why are you doing everything in LONGEST?
     Speed isn't important, but agent code size is; using LONGEST
     brings in a bunch of support code to do things like division, etc.
     So this is a serious concern.

     First, note that you don't need different bytecodes for different
     operand sizes.  You can generate code without _knowing_ how big the
     stack elements actually are on the target.  If the target only
     supports 32-bit ints, and you don't send any 64-bit bytecodes,
     everything just works.  The observation here is that the MIPS and
     the Alpha have only fixed-size registers, and you can still get
     C's semantics even though most instructions only operate on
     full-sized words.  You just need to make sure everything is
     properly sign-extended at the right times.  So there is no need
     for 32- and 64-bit variants of the bytecodes.  Just implement
     everything using the largest size you support.

     GDB should certainly check to see what sizes the target supports,
     so the user can get an error earlier, rather than later.  But this
     information is not necessary for correctness.

Why don't you have `>' or `<=' operators?
     I want to keep the interpreter small, and we don't need them.  We
     can combine the `less_' opcodes with `log_not', and swap the order
     of the operands, yielding all four asymmetrical comparison
     operators.  For example, `(x <= y)' is `! (x > y)', which is `! (y
     < x)'.

Why do you have `log_not'?
Why do you have `ext'?
Why do you have `zero_ext'?
     These are all easily synthesized from other instructions, but I
     expect them to be used frequently, and they're simple, so I
     include them to keep bytecode strings short.

     `log_not' is equivalent to `const8 0 equal'; it's used in half the
     relational operators.

     `ext N' is equivalent to `const8 S-N lsh const8 S-N rsh_signed',
     where S is the size of the stack elements; it follows `refM' and
     REG bytecodes when the value should be signed.  See the next
     bulleted item.

     `zero_ext N' is equivalent to `constM MASK log_and'; it's used
     whenever we push the value of a register, because we can't assume
     the upper bits of the register aren't garbage.

Why not have sign-extending variants of the `ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of `ref' operators, and we
     need the `ext' bytecode anyway for accessing bitfields.

Why not have constant-address variants of the `ref' operators?
     Because that would double the number of `ref' operators again, and
     `const32 ADDRESS ref32' is only one byte longer.

Why do the `refN' operators have to support unaligned fetches?
     GDB will generate bytecode that fetches multi-byte values at
     unaligned addresses whenever the executable's debugging
     information tells it to.  Furthermore, GDB does not know the value
     the pointer will have when GDB generates the bytecode, so it
     cannot determine whether a particular fetch will be aligned or not.

     In particular, structure bitfields may be several bytes long, but
     follow no alignment rules; members of packed structures are not
     necessarily aligned either.

     In general, there are many cases where unaligned references occur
     in correct C code, either at the programmer's explicit request, or
     at the compiler's discretion.  Thus, it is simpler to make the GDB
     agent bytecodes work correctly in all circumstances than to make
     GDB guess in each case whether the compiler did the usual thing.

Why are there no side-effecting operators?
     Because our current client doesn't want them?  That's a cheap
     answer.  I think the real answer is that I'm afraid of
     implementing function calls.  We should re-visit this issue after
     the present contract is delivered.

Why aren't the `goto' ops PC-relative?
     The interpreter has the base address around anyway for PC bounds
     checking, and it seemed simpler.

Why is there only one offset size for the `goto' ops?
     Offsets are currently sixteen bits.  I'm not happy with this
     situation either:

     Suppose we have multiple branch ops with different offset sizes.
     As I generate code left-to-right, all my jumps are forward jumps
     (there are no loops in expressions), so I never know the target
     when I emit the jump opcode.  Thus, I have to either always assume
     the largest offset size, or do jump relaxation on the code after I
     generate it, which seems like a big waste of time.

     I can imagine a reasonable expression being longer than 256 bytes.
     I can't imagine one being longer than 64k.  Thus, we need 16-bit
     offsets.  This kind of reasoning is so bogus, but relaxation is
     pathetic.

     The other approach would be to generate code right-to-left.  Then
     I'd always know my offset size.  That might be fun.

Where is the function call bytecode?
     When we add side-effects, we should add this.

Why does the `reg' bytecode take a 16-bit register number?
     Intel's IA-64 architecture has 128 general-purpose registers, and
     128 floating-point registers, and I'm sure it has some random
     control registers.

Why do we need `trace' and `trace_quick'?
     Because GDB needs to record all the memory contents and registers
     an expression touches.  If the user wants to evaluate an expression
     `x->y->z', the agent must record the values of `x' and `x->y' as
     well as the value of `x->y->z'.

Don't the `trace' bytecodes make the interpreter less general?
     They do mean that the interpreter contains special-purpose code,
     but that doesn't mean the interpreter can only be used for that
     purpose.  If an expression doesn't use the `trace' bytecodes, they
     don't get in its way.

Why doesn't `trace_quick' consume its arguments the way everything else does?
     In general, you do want your operators to consume their arguments;
     it's consistent, and generally reduces the amount of stack
     rearrangement necessary.  However, `trace_quick' is a kludge to
     save space; it only exists so we needn't write `dup const8 SIZE
     trace' before every memory reference.  Therefore, it's okay for it
     not to consume its arguments; it's meant for a specific context in
     which we know exactly what it should do with the stack.  If we're
     going to have a kludge, it should be an effective kludge.

Why does `trace16' exist?
     That opcode was added by the customer that contracted Cygnus for
     the data tracing work.  I personally think it is unnecessary;
     objects that large will be quite rare, so it is okay to use `dup
     const16 SIZE trace' in those cases.

     Whatever we decide to do with `trace16', we should at least leave
     opcode 0x30 reserved, to remain compatible with the customer who
     added it.

Appendix G Target Descriptions
******************************

One of the challenges of using GDB to debug embedded systems is that
there are so many minor variants of each processor architecture in use.
It is common practice for vendors to start with a standard processor
core -- ARM, PowerPC, or MIPS, for example -- and then make changes to
adapt it to a particular market niche.  Some architectures have
hundreds of variants, available from dozens of vendors.  This leads to
a number of problems:

   * With so many different customized processors, it is difficult for
     the GDB maintainers to keep up with the changes.

   * Since individual variants may have short lifetimes or limited
     audiences, it may not be worthwhile to carry information about
     every variant in the GDB source tree.

   * When GDB does support the architecture of the embedded system at
     hand, the task of finding the correct architecture name to give the
     `set architecture' command can be error-prone.

   To address these problems, the GDB remote protocol allows a target
system to not only identify itself to GDB, but to actually describe its
own features.  This lets GDB support processor variants it has never
seen before -- to the extent that the descriptions are accurate, and
that GDB understands them.

   GDB must be linked with the Expat library to support XML target
descriptions.  *Note Expat::.

* Menu:

* Retrieving Descriptions::         How descriptions are fetched from a target.
* Target Description Format::       The contents of a target description.
* Predefined Target Types::         Standard types available for target
                                    descriptions.
* Standard Target Features::        Features GDB knows about.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Retrieving Descriptions,  Next: Target Description Format,  Up: Target Descriptions

G.1 Retrieving Descriptions
===========================

Target descriptions can be read from the target automatically, or
specified by the user manually.  The default behavior is to read the
description from the target.  GDB retrieves it via the remote protocol
using `qXfer' requests (*note qXfer: General Query Packets.).  The
ANNEX in the `qXfer' packet will be `target.xml'.  The contents of the
`target.xml' annex are an XML document, of the form described in *note
Target Description Format::.

   Alternatively, you can specify a file to read for the target
description.  If a file is set, the target will not be queried.  The
commands to specify a file are:

`set tdesc filename PATH'
     Read the target description from PATH.

`unset tdesc filename'
     Do not read the XML target description from a file.  GDB will use
     the description supplied by the current target.

`show tdesc filename'
     Show the filename to read for a target description, if any.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Target Description Format,  Next: Predefined Target Types,  Prev: Retrieving Descriptions,  Up: Target Descriptions

G.2 Target Description Format
=============================

A target description annex is an XML (http://www.w3.org/XML/) document
which complies with the Document Type Definition provided in the GDB
sources in `gdb/features/gdb-target.dtd'.  This means you can use
generally available tools like `xmllint' to check that your feature
descriptions are well-formed and valid.  However, to help people
unfamiliar with XML write descriptions for their targets, we also
describe the grammar here.

   Target descriptions can identify the architecture of the remote
target and (for some architectures) provide information about custom
register sets.  They can also identify the OS ABI of the remote target.
GDB can use this information to autoconfigure for your target, or to
warn you if you connect to an unsupported target.

   Here is a simple target description:

     <target version="1.0">
       <architecture>i386:x86-64</architecture>
     </target>

This minimal description only says that the target uses the x86-64
architecture.

   A target description has the following overall form, with [ ] marking
optional elements and ... marking repeatable elements.  The elements
are explained further below.

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "gdb-target.dtd">
     <target version="1.0">
       [ARCHITECTURE]
       [OSABI]
       [COMPATIBLE]
       [FEATURE...]
     </target>

The description is generally insensitive to whitespace and line breaks,
under the usual common-sense rules.  The XML version declaration and
document type declaration can generally be omitted (GDB does not
require them), but specifying them may be useful for XML validation
tools.  The `version' attribute for `<target>' may also be omitted, but
we recommend including it; if future versions of GDB use an incompatible
revision of `gdb-target.dtd', they will detect and report the version
mismatch.

G.2.1 Inclusion
---------------

It can sometimes be valuable to split a target description up into
several different annexes, either for organizational purposes, or to
share files between different possible target descriptions.  You can
divide a description into multiple files by replacing any element of
the target description with an inclusion directive of the form:

     <xi:include href="DOCUMENT"/>

When GDB encounters an element of this form, it will retrieve the named
XML DOCUMENT, and replace the inclusion directive with the contents of
that document.  If the current description was read using `qXfer', then
so will be the included document; DOCUMENT will be interpreted as the
name of an annex.  If the current description was read from a file, GDB
will look for DOCUMENT as a file in the same directory where it found
the original description.

G.2.2 Architecture
------------------

An `<architecture>' element has this form:

       <architecture>ARCH</architecture>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by `set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

G.2.3 OS ABI
------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   An `<osabi>' element has this form:

       <osabi>ABI-NAME</osabi>

   ABI-NAME is an OS ABI name from the same selection accepted by
`set osabi' (*note Configuring the Current ABI: ABI.).

G.2.4 Compatible Architecture
-----------------------------

This optional field was introduced in GDB version 7.0.  Previous
versions of GDB ignore it.

   A `<compatible>' element has this form:

       <compatible>ARCH</compatible>

   ARCH is one of the architectures from the set accepted by `set
architecture' (*note Specifying a Debugging Target: Targets.).

   A `<compatible>' element is used to specify that the target is able
to run binaries in some other than the main target architecture given
by the `<architecture>' element.  For example, on the Cell Broadband
Engine, the main architecture is `powerpc:common' or
`powerpc:common64', but the system is able to run binaries in the `spu'
architecture as well.  The way to describe this capability with
`<compatible>' is as follows:

       <architecture>powerpc:common</architecture>
       <compatible>spu</compatible>

G.2.5 Features
--------------

Each `<feature>' describes some logical portion of the target system.
Features are currently used to describe available CPU registers and the
types of their contents.  A `<feature>' element has this form:

     <feature name="NAME">
       [TYPE...]
       REG...
     </feature>

Each feature's name should be unique within the description.  The name
of a feature does not matter unless GDB has some special knowledge of
the contents of that feature; if it does, the feature should have its
standard name.  *Note Standard Target Features::.

G.2.6 Types
-----------

Any register's value is a collection of bits which GDB must interpret.
The default interpretation is a two's complement integer, but other
types can be requested by name in the register description.  Some
predefined types are provided by GDB (*note Predefined Target Types::),
and the description can define additional composite types.

   Each type element must have an `id' attribute, which gives a unique
(within the containing `<feature>') name to the type.  Types must be
defined before they are used.

   Some targets offer vector registers, which can be treated as arrays
of scalar elements.  These types are written as `<vector>' elements,
specifying the array element type, TYPE, and the number of elements,
COUNT:

     <vector id="ID" type="TYPE" count="COUNT"/>

   If a register's value is usefully viewed in multiple ways, define it
with a union type containing the useful representations.  The `<union>'
element contains one or more `<field>' elements, each of which has a
NAME and a TYPE:

     <union id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </union>

   If a register's value is composed from several separate values,
define it with a structure type.  There are two forms of the `<struct>'
element; a `<struct>' element must either contain only bitfields or
contain no bitfields.  If the structure contains only bitfields, its
total size in bytes must be specified, each bitfield must have an
explicit start and end, and bitfields are automatically assigned an
integer type.  The field's START should be less than or equal to its
END, and zero represents the least significant bit.

     <struct id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END"/>
       ...
     </struct>

   If the structure contains no bitfields, then each field has an
explicit type, and no implicit padding is added.

     <struct id="ID">
       <field name="NAME" type="TYPE"/>
       ...
     </struct>

   If a register's value is a series of single-bit flags, define it with
a flags type.  The `<flags>' element has an explicit SIZE and contains
one or more `<field>' elements.  Each field has a NAME, a START, and an
END.  Only single-bit flags are supported.

     <flags id="ID" size="SIZE">
       <field name="NAME" start="START" end="END"/>
       ...
     </flags>

G.2.7 Registers
---------------

Each register is represented as an element with this form:

     <reg name="NAME"
          bitsize="SIZE"
          [regnum="NUM"]
          [save-restore="SAVE-RESTORE"]
          [type="TYPE"]
          [group="GROUP"]/>

The components are as follows:

NAME
     The register's name; it must be unique within the target
     description.

BITSIZE
     The register's size, in bits.

REGNUM
     The register's number.  If omitted, a register's number is one
     greater than that of the previous register (either in the current
     feature or in a preceding feature); the first register in the
     target description defaults to zero.  This register number is used
     to read or write the register; e.g. it is used in the remote `p'
     and `P' packets, and registers appear in the `g' and `G' packets
     in order of increasing register number.

SAVE-RESTORE
     Whether the register should be preserved across inferior function
     calls; this must be either `yes' or `no'.  The default is `yes',
     which is appropriate for most registers except for some system
     control registers; this is not related to the target's ABI.

TYPE
     The type of the register.  TYPE may be a predefined type, a type
     defined in the current feature, or one of the special types `int'
     and `float'.  `int' is an integer type of the correct size for
     BITSIZE, and `float' is a floating point type (in the
     architecture's normal floating point format) of the correct size
     for BITSIZE.  The default is `int'.

GROUP
     The register group to which this register belongs.  GROUP must be
     either `general', `float', or `vector'.  If no GROUP is specified,
     GDB will not display the register in `info registers'.

G.3 Predefined Target Types
===========================

Type definitions in the self-description can build up composite types
from basic building blocks, but can not define fundamental types.
Instead, standard identifiers are provided by GDB for the fundamental
types.  The currently supported types are:

`int8'
`int16'
`int32'
`int64'
`int128'
     Signed integer types holding the specified number of bits.

`uint8'
`uint16'
`uint32'
`uint64'
`uint128'
     Unsigned integer types holding the specified number of bits.

`code_ptr'
`data_ptr'
     Pointers to unspecified code and data.  The program counter and
     any dedicated return address register may be marked as code
     pointers; printing a code pointer converts it into a symbolic
     address.  The stack pointer and any dedicated address registers
     may be marked as data pointers.

`ieee_single'
     Single precision IEEE floating point.

`ieee_double'
     Double precision IEEE floating point.

`arm_fpa_ext'
     The 12-byte extended precision format used by ARM FPA registers.

`i387_ext'
     The 10-byte extended precision format used by x87 registers.

`i386_eflags'
     32bit EFLAGS register used by x86.

`i386_mxcsr'
     32bit MXCSR register used by x86.

G.4 Standard Target Features
============================

A target description must contain either no registers or all the
target's registers.  If the description contains no registers, then GDB
will assume a default register layout, selected based on the
architecture.  If the description contains any registers, the default
layout will not be used; the standard registers must be described in
the target description, in such a way that GDB can recognize them.

   This is accomplished by giving specific names to feature elements
which contain standard registers.  GDB will look for features with
those names and verify that they contain the expected registers; if any
known feature is missing required registers, or if any required feature
is missing, GDB will reject the target description.  You can add
additional registers to any of the standard features -- GDB will
display them just as if they were added to an unrecognized feature.

   This section lists the known features and their expected contents.
Sample XML documents for these features are included in the GDB source
tree, in the directory `gdb/features'.

   Names recognized by GDB should include the name of the company or
organization which selected the name, and the overall architecture to
which the feature applies; so e.g. the feature containing ARM core
registers is named `org.gnu.gdb.arm.core'.

   The names of registers are not case sensitive for the purpose of
recognizing standard features, but GDB will only display registers
using the capitalization used in the description.

registers `r0' through `r13', `sp', `lr', `pc', and `xpsr'.

   The `org.gnu.gdb.arm.fpa' feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain registers `f0' through `f7' and `fps'.

should contain at least registers `wR0' through `wR15' and `wCGR0'
through `wCGR3'.  The `wCID', `wCon', `wCSSF', and `wCASF' registers
are optional.

   The `org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp' feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain at least registers `d0' through `d15'.  If they are
present, `d16' through `d31' should also be included.  GDB will
synthesize the single-precision registers from halves of the
double-precision registers.

   The `org.gnu.gdb.arm.neon' feature is optional.  It does not need to
contain registers; it instructs GDB to display the VFP double-precision
registers as vectors and to synthesize the quad-precision registers
from pairs of double-precision registers.  If this feature is present,
`org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp' must also be present and include 32
double-precision registers.

Appendix H Operating System Information
***************************************

* Menu:

* Process list::

   Users of GDB often wish to obtain information about the state of the
operating system running on the target--for example the list of
processes, or the list of open files.  This section describes the
mechanism that makes it possible.  This mechanism is similar to the
target features mechanism (*note Target Descriptions::), but focuses on
a different aspect of target.

   Operating system information is retrived from the target via the
remote protocol, using `qXfer' requests (*note qXfer osdata read::).
The object name in the request should be `osdata', and the ANNEX
identifies the data to be fetched.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Process list,  Up: Operating System Information

H.1 Process list
================

When requesting the process list, the ANNEX field in the `qXfer'
request should be `processes'.  The returned data is an XML document.
The formal syntax of this document is defined in
`gdb/features/osdata.dtd'.

   An example document is:

     <?xml version="1.0"?>
     <!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM "osdata.dtd">
     <osdata type="processes">
       <item>
         <column name="pid">1</column>
         <column name="user">root</column>
         <column name="command">/sbin/init</column>
         <column name="cores">1,2,3</column>
       </item>
     </osdata>

   Each item should include a column whose name is `pid'.  The value of
that column should identify the process on the target.  The `user' and
`command' columns are optional, and will be displayed by GDB.  The
`cores' column, if present, should contain a comma-separated list of
cores that this process is running on.  Target may provide additional
columns, which GDB currently ignores.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Trace File Format,  Next: Index Section Format,  Prev: Operating System Information,  Up: Top

Appendix I Trace File Format
****************************

The trace file comes in three parts: a header, a textual description
section, and a trace frame section with binary data.

   The header has the form `\x7fTRACE0\n'.  The first byte is `0x7f' so
as to indicate that the file contains binary data, while the `0' is a
version number that may have different values in the future.

   The description section consists of multiple lines of ASCII text
separated by newline characters (`0xa').  The lines may include a
variety of optional descriptive or context-setting information, such as
tracepoint definitions or register set size.  GDB will ignore any line
that it does not recognize.  An empty line marks the end of this
section.

   The trace frame section consists of a number of consecutive frames.
Each frame begins with a two-byte tracepoint number, followed by a
four-byte size giving the amount of data in the frame.  The data in the
frame consists of a number of blocks, each introduced by a character
indicating its type (at least register, memory, and trace state
variable).  The data in this section is raw binary, not a hexadecimal
or other encoding; its endianness matches the target's endianness.

`R BYTES'
     Register block.  The number and ordering of bytes matches that of a
     `g' packet in the remote protocol.  Note that these are the actual
     bytes, in target order and GDB register order, not a hexadecimal
     encoding.

`M ADDRESS LENGTH BYTES...'
     Memory block.  This is a contiguous block of memory, at the 8-byte
     address ADDRESS, with a 2-byte length LENGTH, followed by LENGTH
     bytes.

`V NUMBER VALUE'
     Trace state variable block.  This records the 8-byte signed value
     VALUE of trace state variable numbered NUMBER.


   Future enhancements of the trace file format may include additional
types of blocks.


File: gdb.info,  Node: Index Section Format,  Next: Man Pages,  Prev: Trace File Format,  Up: Top

Appendix J `.gdb_index' section format
**************************************

This section documents the index section that is created by `save
gdb-index' (*note Index Files::).  The index section is DWARF-specific;
some knowledge of DWARF is assumed in this description.

   The mapped index file format is designed to be directly `mmap'able
on any architecture.  In most cases, a datum is represented using a
little-endian 32-bit integer value, called an `offset_type'.  Big
endian machines must byte-swap the values before using them.
Exceptions to this rule are noted.  The data is laid out such that
alignment is always respected.

   A mapped index consists of several areas, laid out in order.

  1. The file header.  This is a sequence of values, of `offset_type'
     unless otherwise noted:

       1. The version number, currently 8.  Versions 1, 2 and 3 are
          obsolete.  Version 4 uses a different hashing function from
          versions 5 and 6.  Version 6 includes symbols for inlined
          functions, whereas versions 4 and 5 do not.  Version 7 adds
          attributes to the CU indices in the symbol table.  Version 8
          specifies that symbols from DWARF type units
          (`DW_TAG_type_unit') refer to the type unit's symbol table
          and not the compilation unit (`DW_TAG_comp_unit') using the
          type.

          GDB will only read version 4, 5, or 6 indices by specifying
          `set use-deprecated-index-sections on'.  GDB has a workaround
          for potentially broken version 7 indices so it is currently
          not flagged as deprecated.

       2. The offset, from the start of the file, of the CU list.

       3. The offset, from the start of the file, of the types CU list.
          Note that this area can be empty, in which case this offset
          will be equal to the next offset.

       4. The offset, from the start of the file, of the address area.

       5. The offset, from the start of the file, of the symbol table.

       6. The offset, from the start of the file, of the constant pool.

  2. The CU list.  This is a sequence of pairs of 64-bit little-endian
     values, sorted by the CU offset.  The first element in each pair is
     the offset of a CU in the `.debug_info' section.  The second
     element in each pair is the length of that CU.  References to a CU
     elsewhere in the map are done using a CU index, which is just the
     0-based index into this table.  Note that if there are type CUs,
     then conceptually CUs and type CUs form a single list for the
     purposes of CU indices.

  3. The types CU list.  This is a sequence of triplets of 64-bit
     little-endian values.  In a triplet, the first value is the CU
     offset, the second value is the type offset in the CU, and the
     third value is the type signature.  The types CU list is not
     sorted.

  4. The address area.  The address area consists of a sequence of
     address entries.  Each address entry has three elements:

       1. The low address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.

       2. The high address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.  Like
          `DW_AT_high_pc', the value is one byte beyond the end.

       3. The CU index.  This is an `offset_type' value.

  5. The symbol table.  This is an open-addressed hash table.  The size
     of the hash table is always a power of 2.

     Each slot in the hash table consists of a pair of `offset_type'
     values.  The first value is the offset of the symbol's name in the
     constant pool.  The second value is the offset of the CU vector in
     the constant pool.

     If both values are 0, then this slot in the hash table is empty.
     This is ok because while 0 is a valid constant pool index, it
     cannot be a valid index for both a string and a CU vector.

     The hash value for a table entry is computed by applying an
     iterative hash function to the symbol's name.  Starting with an
     initial value of `r = 0', each (unsigned) character `c' in the
     string is incorporated into the hash using the formula depending
     on the index version:

    Version 4
          The formula is `r = r * 67 + c - 113'.

    Versions 5 to 7
          The formula is `r = r * 67 + tolower (c) - 113'.

     The terminating `\0' is not incorporated into the hash.

     The step size used in the hash table is computed via `((hash * 17)
     & (size - 1)) | 1', where `hash' is the hash value, and `size' is
     the size of the hash table.  The step size is used to find the
     next candidate slot when handling a hash collision.

     The names of C++ symbols in the hash table are canonicalized.  We
     don't currently have a simple description of the canonicalization
     algorithm; if you intend to create new index sections, you must
     read the code.

  6. The constant pool.  This is simply a bunch of bytes.  It is
     organized so that alignment is correct: CU vectors are stored
     first, followed by strings.

     A CU vector in the constant pool is a sequence of `offset_type'
     values.  The first value is the number of CU indices in the vector.
     Each subsequent value is the index and symbol attributes of a CU in
     the CU list.  This element in the hash table is used to indicate
     which CUs define the symbol and how the symbol is used.  See below
     for the format of each CU index+attributes entry.

     A string in the constant pool is zero-terminated.

   Attributes were added to CU index values in `.gdb_index' version 7.
If a symbol has multiple uses within a CU then there is one CU
index+attributes value for each use.

   The format of each CU index+attributes entry is as follows (bit 0 =
LSB):

Bits 0-23
     This is the index of the CU in the CU list.

Bits 24-27
     These bits are reserved for future purposes and must be zero.

Bits 28-30
     The kind of the symbol in the CU.

    0
          This value is reserved and should not be used.  By reserving
          zero the full `offset_type' value is backwards compatible
          with previous versions of the index.

    1
          The symbol is a type.

    2
          The symbol is a variable or an enum value.

    3
          The symbol is a function.

    4
          Any other kind of symbol.

    5,6,7
          These values are reserved.

Bit 31
     This bit is zero if the value is global and one if it is static.

     The determination of whether a symbol is global or static is
     complicated.  The authorative reference is the file `dwarf2read.c'
     in GDB sources.


   This pseudo-code describes the computation of a symbol's kind and
global/static attributes in the index.

     is_external = get_attribute (die, DW_AT_external);
     language = get_attribute (cu_die, DW_AT_language);
     switch (die->tag)
       {
       case DW_TAG_typedef:
       case DW_TAG_base_type:
       case DW_TAG_subrange_type:

         break;
       case DW_TAG_subprogram:
         kind = FUNCTION;
         is_static = ! (is_external || language == ADA);
         break;
       case DW_TAG_constant:

         is_static = ! is_external;
         break;
       case DW_TAG_namespace:
         kind = TYPE;
         is_static = 0;
         break;

         kind = TYPE;
         is_static = (language != CPLUS && language != JAVA);
         break;
       default:
         assert (0);

gdb [`-help'] [`-nh'] [`-nx'] [`-q'] [`-batch'] [`-cd='DIR] [`-f']

   The purpose of a debugger such as GDB is to allow you to see what is
going on "inside" another program while it executes - or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.

   GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:

   * Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its
     behavior.

   * Make your program stop on specified conditions.

   * Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

   * Change things in your program, so you can experiment with
     correcting the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.

   You can use GDB to debug programs written in C, C++, Fortran and
Modula-2.

   GDB is invoked with the shell command `gdb'.  Once started, it reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the GDB
command `quit'.  You can get online help from GDB itself by using the
command `help'.

   You can run `gdb' with no arguments or options; but the most usual
way to start GDB is with one argument or two, specifying an executable
program as the argument:

     gdb program

   You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:

     gdb program core

   You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument, if you
want to debug a running process:

     gdb program 1234
     gdb -p 1234

would attach GDB to process `1234' (unless you also have a file named
`1234'; GDB does check for a core file first).  With option `-p' you
can omit the PROGRAM filename.

   Here are some of the most frequently needed GDB commands:

`break [FILE:]FUNCTIOP'
     Set a breakpoint at FUNCTION (in FILE).

`run [ARGLIST]'
     Start your program (with ARGLIST, if specified).

`bt'
     Backtrace: display the program stack.

`print EXPR'
     Display the value of an expression.

`c'
     Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a
     breakpoint).

`next'
     Execute next program line (after stopping); step _over_ any
     function calls in the line.

`edit [FILE:]FUNCTION'
     look at the program line where it is presently stopped.

`list [FILE:]FUNCTION'
     type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is
     presently stopped.

`step'
     Execute next program line (after stopping); step _into_ any
     function calls in the line.

`help [NAME]'
     Show information about GDB command NAME, or general information
     about using GDB.

`quit'
     Exit from GDB.

   Any arguments other than options specify an executable file and core
file (or process ID); that is, the first argument encountered with no
associated option flag is equivalent to a `-se' option, and the second,
if any, is equivalent to a `-c' option if it's the name of a file.
Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown here.  The
long forms are also recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough
of the option is present to be unambiguous.  (If you prefer, you can
flag option arguments with `+' rather than `-', though we illustrate the
more usual convention.)

   All the options and command line arguments you give are processed in
sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the `-x' option is
used.

`-help'
`-h'
     List all options, with brief explanations.

`-symbols=FILE'
`-s FILE'
     Read symbol table from file FILE.

`-write'
     Enable writing into executable and core files.

`-exec=FILE'
`-e FILE'
     Use file FILE as the executable file to execute when appropriate,
     and for examining pure data in conjunction with a core dump.

`-se=FILE'
     Read symbol table from file FILE and use it as the executable file.

`-core=FILE'
`-c FILE'
     Use file FILE as a core dump to examine.

`-command=FILE'
`-x FILE'
     Execute GDB commands from file FILE.

`-ex COMMAND'
     Execute given GDB COMMAND.

`-directory=DIRECTORY'
`-d DIRECTORY'
     Add DIRECTORY to the path to search for source files.

`-nh'
     Do not execute commands from `~/.gdbinit'.

`-nx'
`-n'
     Do not execute commands from any `.gdbinit' initialization files.

`-quiet'
`-q'
     "Quiet".  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.
     These messages are also suppressed in batch mode.

`-batch'
     Run in batch mode.  Exit with status `0' after processing all the
     command files specified with `-x' (and `.gdbinit', if not
     inhibited).  Exit with nonzero status if an error occurs in
     executing the GDB commands in the command files.

     Batch mode may be useful for running GDB as a filter, for example
     to download and run a program on another computer; in order to
     make this more useful, the message

          Program exited normally.

     (which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under GDB
     control terminates) is not issued when running in batch mode.

`-cd=DIRECTORY'
     Run GDB using DIRECTORY as its working directory, instead of the
     current directory.

`-fullname'
`-f'
     Emacs sets this option when it runs GDB as a subprocess.  It tells
     GDB to output the full file name and line number in a standard,
     recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is displayed (which
     includes each time the program stops).  This recognizable format
     looks like two `\032' characters, followed by the file name, line
     number and character position separated by colons, and a newline.
     The Emacs-to-GDB interface program uses the two `\032' characters
     as a signal to display the source code for the frame.

`-b BPS'
     Set the line speed (baud rate or bits per second) of any serial
     interface used by GDB for remote debugging.

`-tty=DEVICE'
     Run using DEVICE for your program's standard input and output.

gdbserver man
=============

gdbserver COMM PROG [ARGS...]

gdbserver -attach COMM PID

gdbserver -multi COMM

   `gdbserver' is a program that allows you to run GDB on a different
machine than the one which is running the program being debugged.

Usage (server (target) side)
----------------------------

   First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put
onto the target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if
needed, as `gdbserver' doesn't care about symbols.  All symbol handling
is taken care of by the GDB running on the host system.

   To use the server, you log on to the target system, and run the
`gdbserver' program.  You must tell it (a) how to communicate with GDB,
(b) the name of your program, and (c) its arguments.  The general
syntax is:

     target> gdbserver COMM PROGRAM [ARGS ...]

   For example, using a serial port, you might say:

     target> gdbserver `/dev/com1' emacs foo.txt

   This tells `gdbserver' to debug emacs with an argument of foo.txt,
and to communicate with GDB via `/dev/com1'.  `gdbserver' now waits
patiently for the host GDB to communicate with it.

   To use a TCP connection, you could say:

     target> gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt

   This says pretty much the same thing as the last example, except
that we are going to communicate with the `host' GDB via TCP.  The
`host:2345' argument means that we are expecting to see a TCP
connection from `host' to local TCP port 2345.  (Currently, the `host'
part is ignored.)  You can choose any number you want for the port
number as long as it does not conflict with any existing TCP ports on
the target system.  This same port number must be used in the host GDBs
`target remote' command, which will be described shortly.  Note that if
you chose a port number that conflicts with another service,
`gdbserver' will print an error message and exit.

   `gdbserver' can also attach to running programs.  This is
accomplished via the `--attach' argument.  The syntax is:

     target> gdbserver --attach COMM PID

   PID is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't
necessary to point `gdbserver' at a binary for the running process.

   To start `gdbserver' without supplying an initial command to run or
process ID to attach, use the `--multi' command line option.  In such
case you should connect using `target extended-remote' to start the
program you want to debug.

     target> gdbserver --multi COMM

Usage (host side)
-----------------

   You need an unstripped copy of the target program on your host
system, since GDB needs to examine it's symbol tables and such.  Start
up GDB as you normally would, with the target program as the first
argument.  (You may need to use the `--baud' option if the serial line
is running at anything except 9600 baud.)  That is `gdb TARGET-PROG',
or `gdb --baud BAUD TARGET-PROG'.  After that, the only new command you
need to know about is `target remote' (or `target extended-remote').
Its argument is either a device name (usually a serial device, like
`/dev/ttyb'), or a `HOST:PORT' descriptor.  For example:

     (gdb) target remote `/dev/ttyb'

communicates with the server via serial line `/dev/ttyb', and:

     (gdb) target remote the-target:2345

communicates via a TCP connection to port 2345 on host `the-target',
where you previously started up `gdbserver' with the same port number.
Note that for TCP connections, you must start up `gdbserver' prior to
using the `target remote' command, otherwise you may get an error that
looks something like `Connection refused'.

   `gdbserver' can also debug multiple inferiors at once, described in
*note Inferiors and Programs::.  In such case use the `extended-remote'
GDB command variant:

     (gdb) target extended-remote the-target:2345

   The `gdbserver' option `--multi' may or may not be used in such case.

   There are three different modes for invoking `gdbserver':

   * Debug a specific program specified by its program name:

          gdbserver COMM PROG [ARGS...]

     The COMM parameter specifies how should the server communicate
     with GDB; it is either a device name (to use a serial line), a TCP
     port number (`:1234'), or `-' or `stdio' to use stdin/stdout of
     `gdbserver'.  Specify the name of the program to debug in PROG.
     Any remaining arguments will be passed to the program verbatim.
     When the program exits, GDB will close the connection, and
     `gdbserver' will exit.

   * Debug a specific program by specifying the process ID of a running
     program:

          gdbserver --attach COMM PID

     The COMM parameter is as described above.  Supply the process ID
     of a running program in PID; GDB will do everything else.  Like
     with the previous mode, when the process PID exits, GDB will close
     the connection, and `gdbserver' will exit.

   * Multi-process mode - debug more than one program/process:

          gdbserver --multi COMM

     In this mode, GDB can instruct `gdbserver' which command(s) to
     run.  Unlike the other 2 modes, GDB will not close the connection
     when a process being debugged exits, so you can debug several
     processes in the same session.

   In each of the modes you may specify these options:

`--help'
     List all options, with brief explanations.

`--version'
     This option causes `gdbserver' to print its version number and
     exit.

`--attach'
     `gdbserver' will attach to a running program.  The syntax is:

          target> gdbserver --attach COMM PID

     PID is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn't
     necessary to point `gdbserver' at a binary for the running process.

`--multi'
     To start `gdbserver' without supplying an initial command to run
     or process ID to attach, use this command line option.  Then you
     can connect using `target extended-remote' and start the program
     you want to debug.  The syntax is:

          target> gdbserver --multi COMM

`--debug'
     Instruct `gdbserver' to display extra status information about the
     debugging process.  This option is intended for `gdbserver'
     development and for bug reports to the developers.

`--remote-debug'
     Instruct `gdbserver' to display remote protocol debug output.
     This option is intended for `gdbserver' development and for bug
     reports to the developers.

`--wrapper'
     Specify a wrapper to launch programs for debugging.  The option
     should be followed by the name of the wrapper, then any
     command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then `--'
     indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.

`--once'
     By default, `gdbserver' keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
     additional connections are possible.  However, if you start
     `gdbserver' with the `--once' option, it will stop listening for
     any further connection attempts after connecting to the first GDB
     session.

gcore
=====

gcore [-o FILENAME] PID

   Generate a core dump of a running program with process ID PID.
Produced file is equivalent to a kernel produced core file as if the
process crashed (and if `ulimit -c' were used to set up an appropriate
core dump limit).  Unlike after a crash, after `gcore' the program
remains running without any change.

`-o FILENAME'
     The optional argument FILENAME specifies the file name where to
     put the core dump.  If not specified, the file name defaults to
     `core.PID', where PID is the running program process ID.

Appendix L GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*************************************

                        Version 3, 29 June 2007

     Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
     license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works.

   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use
the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies
also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply
it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains
in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of
users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
====================

  0. Definitions.

     "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
     License.

     "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
     kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

     "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
     License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
     "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

     To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the
     work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the
     making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified
     version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

     A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work
     based on the Program.

     To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
     permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
     infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
     on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes
     copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
     available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
     well.

     To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
     parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
     through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
     conveying.

     An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
     to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
     feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
     tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to
     the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may
     convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this
     License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or
     options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
     criterion.

  1. Source Code.

     The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
     for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any
     non-source form of a work.

     A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an
     official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
     the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
     language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
     language.

     The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything,
     other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal
     form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that
     Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
     with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
     for which an implementation is available to the public in source
     code form.  A "Major Component", in this context, means a major
     essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the
     specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work
     runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
     interpreter used to run it.

     The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
     the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including
     scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include
     the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
     available free programs which are used unmodified in performing
     those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example,
     Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
     associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
     shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
     is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
     communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
     parts of the work.

     The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
     regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
     Source.

     The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
     same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

     All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
     copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
     conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
     permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running
     a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,
     given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License
     acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as
     provided by copyright law.

     You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
     convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise
     remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the
     sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for
     you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
     provided that you comply with the terms of this License in
     conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
     Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so
     exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on
     terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
     copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

     Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
     the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section
     10 makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

     No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
     measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
     article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
     1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of
     such measures.

     When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
     circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
     circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
     with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention
     to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of
     enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal
     rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

     You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
     receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
     appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
     keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
     code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
     give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

     You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
     and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

     You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
     produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
     terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
     conditions:

       a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you
          modified it, and giving a relevant date.

       b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
          released under this License and any conditions added under
          section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in
          section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

       c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
          License will therefore apply, along with any applicable
          section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
          its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License
          gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but
          it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately
          received it.

       d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
          interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
          Notices, your work need not make them do so.

     A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
     works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered
     work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger
     program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
     called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting
     copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
     compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
     Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
     License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

     You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
     of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this
     License, in one of these ways:

       a. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
          Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
          customarily used for software interchange.

       b. Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
          written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for
          as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that
          product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
          either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the
          software in the product that is covered by this License, on a
          durable physical medium customarily used for software
          interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of
          physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
          to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no
          charge.

       c. Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of
          the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
          alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially,
          and only if you received the object code with such an offer,
          in accord with subsection 6b.

       d. Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access
          to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
          place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients
          to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.
          If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
          Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated
          by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying
          facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to
          the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
          Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you
          remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long
          as needed to satisfy these requirements.

       e. Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
          provided you inform other peers where the object code and
          Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the
          general public at no charge under subsection 6d.


     A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
     excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need
     not be included in conveying the object code work.

     A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means
     any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
     family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
     incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product
     is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
     coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
     "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
     product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the
     way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is
     expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product
     regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial,
     industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the
     only significant mode of use of the product.

     "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
     procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
     install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that
     User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.
     The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
     functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
     interfered with solely because modification has been made.

     If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with,
     or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying
     occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession
     and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in
     perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction
     is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this
     section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But
     this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
     retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
     Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not
     include a requirement to continue to provide support service,
     warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or
     installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it
     has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied
     when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
     operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for
     communication across the network.

     Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
     provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
     publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
     public in source code form), and must require no special password
     or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

     "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of
     this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
     conditions.  Additional permissions that are applicable to the
     entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in
     this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable
     law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program,
     that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the
     entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to
     the additional permissions.

     When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
     remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
     of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
     removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
     additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
     for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
     you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
     holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License
     with terms:

       a. Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from
          the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

       b. Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices
          or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate
          Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

       c. Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
          or requiring that modified versions of such material be
          marked in reasonable ways as different from the original
          version; or

       d. Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
          or authors of the material; or

       e. Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
          trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

       f. Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
          material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified
          versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to
          the recipient, for any liability that these contractual
          assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

     All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as
     you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that
     it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further
     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document
     contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or
     conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work
     material governed by the terms of that license document, provided
     that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or
     conveying.

     If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
     must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
     additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
     where to find the applicable terms.

     Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in
     the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
     the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

     You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
     provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
     modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License (including any patent licenses granted under
     the third paragraph of section 11).

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new
     licenses for the same material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

     You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
     run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
     occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer
     transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require
     acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you
     permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions
     infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
     by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
     acceptance of this License to do so.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

     Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
     receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not
     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
     License.

     An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
     organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
     organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a
     covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
     transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
     licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
     could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
     possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
     predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
     with reasonable efforts.

     You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
     rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
     may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
     exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not
     initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
     lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
     using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any
     portion of it.

 11. Patents.

     A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
     License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.
     The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor
     version".

     A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
     owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
     hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner,
     permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
     contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
     infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
     contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, "control"
     includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner
     consistent with the requirements of this License.

     Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
     royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential
     patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and
     otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its
     contributor version.

     In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any
     express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
     enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a
     patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To
     "grant" such a patent license to a party means to make such an
     agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

     If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent
     license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available
     for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
     License, through a publicly available network server or other
     readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
     Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
     yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular
     work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements
     of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream
     recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have actual knowledge
     that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work
     in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
     country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
     country that you have reason to believe are valid.

     If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
     arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
     covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
     receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
     modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
     patent license you grant is automatically extended to all
     recipients of the covered work and works based on it.

     A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
     the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
     conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that
     are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a
     covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
     party that is in the business of distributing software, under
     which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of
     your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third
     party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered
     work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection
     with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made
     from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with
     specific products or compilations that contain the covered work,
     unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license
     was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

     Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
     any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
     otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
     simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
     pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
     at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to
     collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you
     convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
     terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
     the Program.

 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
     permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
     under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
     single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms
     of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
     covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero
     General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through
     a network will apply to the combination as such.

 14. Revised Versions of this License.

     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.
     Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
     version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
     concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU
     General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that numbered version or of any later version published by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a
     version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

     If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
     versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

     Later license versions may give you additional or different
     permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
     author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
     later version.

 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

     THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
     APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
     COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE
     RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
     SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 16. Limitation of Liability.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES
     AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
     FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

     If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
     above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
     reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
     approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
     connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
     liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.


END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
===========================

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     PROGRAM Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an "about box".

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU GPL, see `http://www.gnu.org/licenses/'.

   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But first,
please read `http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html'.

Appendix M GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                     Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     `http://fsf.org/'

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

 11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
