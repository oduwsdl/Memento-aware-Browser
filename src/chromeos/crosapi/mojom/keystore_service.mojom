// long-term stabilization.

// The system has a keystore and a certificate store. Keys are tuples
// of (private key, public key). These are generated by the system and the
// private key is never shared. Certificates provide proof of ownership of a
// private key. There are many uses for keys and certificates -- this interface
// currently focuses on the use cases for the enterprise_platform_keys extension
// API.

// Both keystores and certificate stores have two variants: device and user.
// Device keys/certificates are available to all affiliated users on the device.
// User keys/certificates are only available to the current user.
